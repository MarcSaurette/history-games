# Background Survey

When teaching face to face, I  always begin the year getting a sense of who students are, what is the background, why they decided to take the course etc. I want to know this information because it helps me understand how much or how little people already know about the Middle Ages. This year, I've decided to create a simple form to get feedback from all of you about this sort of information instead.&#x20;

Depending on how much you want to talk about yourself, it shouldn't take more than 10 minutes to fill out.&#x20;

1. Click on this [link](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=lRjZagbeXki8UfzhJsyFMOouN9xOcPBFmXXZx7xcRchUNDRINExLQldIWkNWQVdKN1pQT0ZPTEFMTCQlQCN0PWcu).
2. Fill in the questions. &#x20;
3. Click Submit.&#x20;

Thanks! I'll have other forms for you to fill out throughout the term that I'll post in different weeks!
